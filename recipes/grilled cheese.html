    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Grilled cheese is a classic American sandwich that has been around since 1920. It is a hot sandwich made with buttered and toasted bread and originally filled with American cheese, but is now commonly made with one or more different cheeses.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread – a thicker sliced bread such as texas toast works best</li>
        <li>Butter – use a generous 1/2 Tbsp of butter on each slice of bread. We use unsalted but any butter will work here.</li>
        <li>Cheese – we use a combination of sliced medium cheddar, gouda and Havarti cheese.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Butter the toast – spread 1/2 Tbsp butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Heat skillet – place a skillet over low to medium/low heat. A griddle should be at 275˚F. Immediately add 2 slices of bread with the butter-side-down.</li>
        <li>Add cheese – stack cheeses on one of the pieces of bread, cover with the other piece of toast and flip the sandwich over.</li>
        <li>Brown the toast – Continue sauteeing, flipping once, until both sides are golden brown and cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Serve – cut the sandwich in half on the diagonal to serve.</li>
    </ol>
